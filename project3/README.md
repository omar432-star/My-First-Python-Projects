🏝️ Treasure Island
A text-based adventure game where your choices determine your fate. Will you find the hidden gold, or fall into a deadly trap?

📖 About the Project
This is a simple logic-based game created as part of my Python learning journey. The goal is to navigate through a series of choices (Left or Right, Swim or Wait, Which door?) to reach the final treasure.

🕹️ How to Play
Run the script: python treasure_island.py

Read the story descriptions carefully.

Type your choice (e.g., left, wait, or red) and press Enter.

Try to survive and find the treasure!

🛠️ Concepts Used
Input handling and string manipulation.

Nested conditional statements (if, elif, else).

Logic flow and decision trees.
